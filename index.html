            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>I am a web developer with experience working on both front end and back end projects, including extensive exposure to MEAN stack JavaScript technologies and modern, responsive CSS design.</p>
            <p>My main goal in my work is to collaborate closely with others, be they developers, non technical team members or clients, to choose the most appropriate solution to a given set of user needs and then to use that to create a product that is intuitive and powerful. This can mean quickly prototyping skeleton pages with Twitter Bootstrap then working incrementally with a designer to produce a fully bespoke final version or helping a client decide between a fully custom app hosted on AWS or a relatively simple WordPress site.</p>
            <p>My recent personal development projects include a small app to allow a player of the game Android Netrunner (well, me, but it could be used by another player) to track their level of success with certain types of decks against others.</p>

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <div>
                <h5>JavaScript</h5>
                <p>I've done extensive work with JavaScript, both in the browser and on the server with NodeJS and Express. Recently the bulk of my work has been with AngularJS, which I feel provides a large amount of flexibility and power without requiring excessive amounts of boilerplate to get started with a project. This ties in well with other parts of the JavaScript ecosystem, particularly partnered with npm, to create something with the minimal replication of work that has already been done, allowing me to get on with writing the things that are novel or unique to the current project.</p>
                <p>Having worked on products that were required to run the same code on the server and in the browser, including older versions of IE and Safari to the same result I've gained a healthy respect for some of the particular rough edges that need to be avoided to make things work everywhere (particularly around events and concurrency).</p>
                <p>I've also had some exposure to technologies like TypeScript and Angular 2.0 through courses and building toy personal projects, although I've not used either in production.</p>
                <h5>CSS</h5>
                <p>I have worked a lot with CSS, particularly with the LESS pre-processor, to produce attractive pages that provide users with the same experience, or as close as possible to it, on a wide range of devices and browsers. While working at Lighthouse Learning in particular, I was working on an application that had to provide the same on-brand experience on an interactive whiteboard and an iPhone. I've worked on projects that include CSS frameworks, particularly Twitter Bootstrap and others that build everything from scratch.</p>
                <h5>Project Management</h5>
                <p>In my previous position I ended up leading the development team which involved extensive work with the company director to develop our priorities for each sprint, assigning out work to other developers and managing the deployment of each new release of the codebase. This gave me a lot of opportunities to work directly with people from all parts of the company to ensure we were all working towards the same goals, as well as time to get better at estimating how long projects should take, taking into account how busy the various participants were and to improve my own time management.</p>
                <h5>Other Skills</h5>
                <p>I'd be happy to discuss my experience with MongoDB, WordPress, CreateJS, Grunt, Java, Git and AWS.</p>

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <div>
                <h5>2014-2016 - Developer at Lighthouse Learning</h5>
                <p>Skills used:<br>AngularJS, Grunt, NPM, Git, NodeJS, MongoDB, AWS, LESS, responsive and cross-browser design, agile development, CreateJS, HTML, project management</p>
                <p>Role overview:<br>Developer working closely with the marketing and production teams to create engaging learning experiences that closely matched our customers' needs as well as helping manage the overall direction of the product. I came on at Lighthouse as a junior developer out of university and acquired more responsibility over my time there, eventually being given responsibility over the release cycle of the core product, managing the code base through Git, preparing deployments to AWS, overseeing testing and prioritising new features to delegate out to other developers. The scale of the development team was such that I worked on a wide variety of projects all over the technology stack from small visual tweaks on the website to refactoring customer data on the CRM we built in-house to developing new features for the game engine and associated tooling that the educational content itself ran on.</p>
                <p>Interesting challenges:<br>As Lighthouse's primary customers are schools and many schools, particularly in the states, have fairly old technology and locked down policies about when they could get updates (never) the biggest challenge was always making sure that everything performed well and looked correct on a wide range of browsers and devices. This was compounded because we also compiled the web product into an iOS app with Phonegap which added an even greater range of devices and browsers that it all had to hold up on.</p>
