            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>I am a web developer with experience working on both front end and back end projects, including extensive exposure to MEAN stack JavaScript technologies and modern, responsive CSS design. Recently I've worked full-time at an education technology startup, working with a varied team to develop a complex cross-platform application and support systems including the custom content management and customer support systems used internally.</p>
            <p>My main goal in my work is to collaborate closely with others, be they developers, non-technical team members or clients, to choose the most appropriate solution to a given set of user needs and then to use that to create a product that is intuitive and powerful. This can mean quickly prototyping skeleton pages with Twitter Bootstrap then working incrementally with a designer to produce a fully bespoke final version or helping a client decide between a fully custom app hosted on AWS or an easy-to-maintain WordPress site.</p>
            <p>My recent personal projects include a minimal app to allow a player of the game Android: Netrunner to track their level of success with certain types of decks against others<span class="webOnly"> which can be seen <a href="./decktracker/">here</a></span>, and a very skeletal prototype for a smart phone comparison tool for Xiaomi devices to help a friend visualise the differences in the range<span class="webOnly"> which is <a href=./letmiexplain/>here</a></span>.</p>

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <div>
                <h5>JavaScript</h5>
                <p>I've done extensive work with JavaScript, both in the browser and on the server with Node.js and Express. Recently the bulk of my work has been with AngularJS, which I feel provides a large amount of flexibility and power without requiring excessive amounts of boilerplate to get started with a project. This ties in well with other parts of the JavaScript ecosystem, particularly partnered with npm, to create something with the minimal replication of work that has already been done, allowing me to get on with writing the things that are novel or unique to the current project.</p>
                <p>Having worked on products that were required to run the same code on the server and in the browser, including older versions of IE and Safari to the same result I've gained a healthy respect for some of the particular rough edges that need to be avoided to make things work everywhere (particularly around events and concurrency).</p>
                <p>I've also had some exposure to technologies like TypeScript and React through courses and building toy personal projects, although I've not used either in production.</p>
                <h5>CSS</h5>
                <p>I have worked a lot with CSS, particularly with the LESS pre-processor, to produce attractive pages that provide users with the same experience, or as close as possible to it, on a wide range of devices and browsers. While working at Lighthouse Learning in particular, I was working on an application that had to provide the same on-brand experience on an interactive whiteboard and an iPhone. I've worked on projects that include CSS frameworks, particularly Twitter Bootstrap and others that build everything from scratch.</p>
                <h5>Project Management</h5>
                <p>At Lighthouse, the scale of the development team meant that I was involved at every point during the project management process from developing our team priorities for the next sprint to polishing and testing each complete product prior to release. After 18 months at the company the previous lead developer moved on to a new position elsewhere and I was asked to lead the dev team which I did for the remainder of my time there. In this position I had to collaborate extensively with other members of the company to ensure that as a dev team we were working towards the same goals as the rest of the company as well as managing the deployment of each iteration of the code base and staying abreast of upcoming potential problems that we might need to overcome.</p>
                <p>The added responsibility I had there gave me a particular appreciation for the importance of time management when working with multiple different people on a given project, including accounting for what else all participants in a project was likely to be required to do in the near future and ensuring there were minimal road blocks where one person would be waiting for others and were forced to regularly context switch to other work.</p>
                <h5>Other Skills</h5>
                <p>I'd be happy to discuss my experience with MongoDB, WordPress, CreateJS, Grunt, Java, Git, PhoneGap and AWS.</p>

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <div>
                <h5>2014-2017 - Developer at Lighthouse Learning</h5>
                <p>Skills used:<br>AngularJS, Grunt, NPM, Git, Node.js, MongoDB, AWS, LESS, responsive and cross-browser design, agile development, CreateJS, HTML, project management</p>
                <p>Role overview:<br>Developer working closely with the marketing and production teams to create engaging learning experiences that closely matched our customers' needs as well as helping manage the overall direction of the product. I came on at Lighthouse as a junior developer out of university and acquired more responsibility over my time there, eventually being given responsibility over the release cycle of the core product, managing the code base through Git, preparing deployments to AWS, overseeing testing and prioritising new features to delegate out to other developers. The scale of the development team was such that I worked on a wide variety of projects all over the technology stack from small visual tweaks on the website to refactoring customer data on the CRM we built in-house, to developing new features for the game engine and associated tooling that the educational content itself ran on.</p>
                <p>Interesting challenges:<br>As Lighthouse's primary customers are schools and many schools, particularly in the states, have fairly old technology and locked down policies about when they could get updates (never) the biggest challenge was always making sure that everything performed well and looked correct on a wide range of browsers and devices. This was compounded because we also compiled the web product into an iOS app with Phonegap which added an even greater range of devices and browsers that it all had to hold up on.</p>
