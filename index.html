            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>I am a web developer with experience working on both front end and back end projects, including extensive exposure to MEAN stack JavaScript technologies and modern, responsive CSS design.</p>
            <p>My main goal in my work is to collaborate closely with others, be they developers, non technical team members or clients, to choose the most appropriate solution to a given set of user needs and then to use that to create a product that is intuitive and powerful. This can mean quickly prototyping skeleton pages with Twitter Bootstrap then working incrementally with a designer to produce a fully bespoke final version or helping a client decide between a fully custom app hosted on AWS or a relatively simple WordPress site.</p>
            <p>My recent personal development projects include a small app to allow a player of the game Android Netrunner (well, me, but it could be used by another player) to track their level of success with certain types of decks against others.</p>

            <div>
                <h5>2014-2016 - Developer at Lighthouse Learning</h5>
                <p>Skills used: AngularJS, Grunt, NPM, Git, NodeJS, MongoDB, AWS, LESS, responsive and cross-browser design, agile development, CreateJS, HTML, project management</p>
                <p>Role overview: Developer working closely with the marketing and production teams to create engaging learning experiences that closely matched our clients needs as well as helping manage the overall direction of the product. I came on at Lighthouse as a junior developer out of university and acquired more responsibility over my time there, eventually being given responsibility over the release cycle of the core product, managing the code base through Git, preparing deployments to AWS, overseeing testing and prioritising new features to delegate out to other developers. The scale of the development team was such that I worked on a wide variety of projects all over the technology stack from small visual tweaks on the website to refactoring customer data on the CRM we built in-house to developing new features for the game engine and associated tooling that the educational content itself ran on.</p>
                <p>Interesting challenges: As Lighthouse's primary customers are schools and many schools, particularly in the states, have fairly old technology and locked down policies about when they could get updates (never) the biggest challenge was always making sure that everything performed well and looked correct on a wide range of browsers and devices. This was compounded because we also compiled the web product into an iOS app with Phonegap which added an even greater range of devices and browsers that it all had to hold up on.</p>
